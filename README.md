## How to Play

Emoji Flipper is a game that tests your ability to select unique cards while avoiding repeats. Here's how to play:

1. Select a difficulty level to start the game.
2. In each round, pick one card from the options presented. Ensure it hasnâ€™t been selected earlier in the game.
3. Complete the required number of unique selections to win the game.
4. Avoid selecting the same card twice, or the game will end!
5. Play quickly and strategically to maximize your score.

*Speed and focus are your keys to successâ€”good luck!*

## Scoring System

Your score is calculated based on two main components:

- **Base Points**: Earned for every unique card selected during a round. The number of points depends on the difficulty level.
- **Bonus Points**: Awarded based on the speed of your selection. The faster you choose, the higher your bonus points.

Your ultimate goal is to maximize your performance, measured as **Points per Second**. Keep your selections fast and unique to achieve the best score!

- **Easy**:
  - Each round presents **4 cards** to choose from.
